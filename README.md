# Shruthi XT Enclosure

![](https://waterpigs.co.uk/img/2018-03-20-shruthi-xt.jpeg)

Design and parts for my wooden Shruthi XT enclosure, optionally laser engraved with graphics inspired by the original design. The parts are designed to be roughly cut out on a CNC router, then finished and trimmed by hand.

## Files

The plans were originally drawn using Eazydraw for Mac. The original files are provided for anyone who uses the same program. Eazydraw exports very clean, well-organised SVGs, so the Shruthi XT Enclosure and Shruthi XT Panel SVG files should be easy to make changes to in any good vector graphics application.

All SVG files have the bound dimensions in mm in the file name, and the material and thickness if applicable. It’s up to the reader to ensure that the scale, material thickness and depth of all cuts is correct in their CAD/CAM software.

## Assembly

Consult the drawings in the Plans file and study the various parts and how they fit together.

I don’t have time to write a detailed assembly guide right now, if anyone actually wants to build this, [email me](barnaby@waterpigs.co.uk) or open an issue on this project and I’ll add better documentation.
